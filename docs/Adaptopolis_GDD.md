Adaptopolis ‚Äî Game Design Document (GDD)

Version: 0.3.0 (matches current implementation)
Engine: Godot 4.4
Languages: English, Chinese (CSV-based)
Genre: Roguelike ¬∑ Strategy ¬∑ City-building
Theme: Climate adaptation and urban resilience

1. Game Concept

Adaptopolis is a grid-based, roguelike city-building strategy game about defending a flood‚Äëprone city. Each round rain intensifies, the city takes damage reduced by total resilience, and the player spends funds in a shop to buy and place infrastructural facilities with distinct shapes.

2. Core Gameplay Loop

Start Round
- HUD shows Round, Health, Funds, Resilience; a rain forecast range is displayed.

Rain Phase
- Rain intensity is generated as random(base_min..base_max) + per_round_increase √ó round.
- Total resilience reduces incoming damage; remaining damage reduces Health.

Income Phase
- If damage is 0, award perfect-round bonus; otherwise award base income. Funds carry over.

Shop + Placement
- Shop offers 3 random facilities. Player selects, optionally rotates, and places on a 6√ó6 grid with buildings and water obstacles.
- Placement must fit the footprint and respect special rules (see 4. Facilities).

End of Round
- Apply any unlocked card effects (e.g., Garden City adds +3 funds).
- Update Round and forecast; continue until Health ‚â§ 0 (Game Over) or after 20 rounds (Victory ‚Üí Endless option).

3. Systems Overview

3.1 City System
- Tracks: Health (max 20), Funds (start 30), Round, facilities, last damage.
- Income: base 6 per round; perfect round bonus +3 when damage == 0.
- Resilience: sum of all facility resilience values.
- Game Over when Health ‚â§ 0. Victory after completing 20 rounds (then Endless mode optional).

3.2 Rain System
- Parameters: base_min=5, base_max=10, per_round_increase=2.
- Forecast cache: HUD shows (min..max) range for the current round.
- Report includes rain intensity, total resilience, damage, and pump events.

3.3 Grid & Spatial System
- Board: 6√ó6 grid.
- Obstacles: Random buildings (4‚Äì5 cells) and water (1‚Äì3 cells) generated at start.
- Rules:
  - No placement on water.
  - Buildings block placement except Green Roofs, which must be placed on building tiles.
  - Pump Station must be orthogonally adjacent to water.
  - Shapes must fit entirely within bounds; preview indicates valid/invalid.
  - Rotation via right-click (Shift for counter‚Äëclockwise).

3.4 Facility System
- Data-driven from JSON (`data/facility_data.json`): id, name, type, type_tags, shape (2D bool), cost, resilience, level, special_rule, unlock_round.
- Levels: 1..3 with cost multipliers {1.0, 1.9, 3.5} and resilience √ó1.5 per level beyond 1.
- Merging: Stack-based. Placing an identical facility of the same level fully overlapping the same footprint merges and upgrades the piece. Adjacency merging is disabled.
- Examples (from current catalog): Rain Garden (1√ó2), Green Roof (1√ó1, building‚Äëonly), Retention Pond (2√ó2 sliced icon), Pump Station (1√ó1, needs adjacent water, ‚àí0.5 funds/round to activate), plus advanced shapes (Constructed Wetland, Bio‚Äëswale, etc.).

3.5 Shop System
- Offers: 3 per refresh; level bias increases with round (L2 chance ‚â•6, L3 chance ‚â•10).
- Purchase: requires sufficient funds and a valid placement origin.
- Skip/Refresh: UI supports skipping a selected offer and refreshing the pool.

3.6 Card System
- Card Bar: persistent panel at the top of the HUD that lists unlocked passive cards.
- Unlocking: cards appear immediately once their in-run condition is satisfied; they persist for the remainder of the run (even if the trigger condition is later broken).
- Synergy Sets (current build, defined in `data/card_data.json`):
  - **Green** ‚Äî Garden City (+3 funds), Eco Network (adjacent greens reduce damage by 1), Urban Canopy (+2 funds), Sponge Block (damage -2, one-time green cost -1).
  - **Grey** ‚Äî Storm Defense Network (Flood Wall + Pump Station halve incoming damage), Urban Hardscape (+2 funds but +1 damage pressure when grey ‚â• 50%).
  - **Blue** ‚Äî Blue Corridor (damage -2 and +1 health with pond‚Äìwetland‚Äìbasin corridor), Living Water System (+1 health when ‚â•2 blue tags).
  - **Blue-Green** ‚Äî Sponge City (Constructed Wetland adjacency yields damage -2, +1 funds), Eco-Drain Chain (Bio-swale ‚Üí Trench ‚Üí Basin chain grants a one-time -3 damage buffer).
  - **Mixed** ‚Äî Resilient Metropolis (+5 funds and damage -1 with ‚â•2 of each colour), Circular City (next build cost -1 with balanced colours and funds ‚â•5), Adaptive Basin System (Pump Station linking Flood Wall + Retention Pond provides damage -3).
- Effects stack alongside base income/damage calculations and are evaluated each round in `main.gd`.

4. Player Progression
- New game: blank 6√ó6 map with random buildings/water, starting funds 30, health 20.
- Difficulty rises with round via rain escalation.
- Victory after 20 completed rounds; then continue in Endless or restart.

5. Balancing Notes (Current)
- Green (nature-based) options tend to be cheaper and flexible; Grey options costlier but strong.
- Spatial pressure from random buildings + water encourages planning and rotation.
- Simple income (base + perfect bonus) emphasizes damage avoidance without heavy bookkeeping.

6. Localization & UI
- CSV translations (en, zh) loaded at runtime; HUD shows forecast and core stats.
- Facility info panel on hover; supports selling at 60% of current cost.

7. Roadmap (Future)
- Optional adjacency‚Äëmerge variant, richer income tiers by damage, events, and synergies; expanded art for all facilities.
Players doing well earn more ‚Üí buy better Resilience.

Players taking damage earn less ‚Üí downward pressure.

Creates tension typical of roguelike escalation.

Merging as Relief Mechanic

Merging frees up space while improving efficiency.

Helps manage grid crowding over long runs.

üåê 6. Localization & Accessibility

Base language: English.

Built-in localization hook using TranslationServer.

Font & UI layout should support multilingual expansion (e.g., Chinese).

Color-only cues should also have text/icons for accessibility.

üé® 7. Visual & Audio Direction (Placeholder Phase)

Visual Style (Prototype):

Use ColorRects for all entities:

Empty cell: light gray

Building: dark gray

Green infrastructure: green hues

Grey infrastructure: blue-gray

Water effect: transparent blue overlay

Audio (Optional):

Calm ambient city sounds between rounds.

Rainfall and thunder during attack phase.

Subtle UI click and merge sounds.

Later, this can evolve toward a minimal ‚Äúisometric city map‚Äù aesthetic with soft environmental soundscape.

üß† 8. Educational Layer

The game‚Äôs educational intent is to communicate:

That urban resilience is systemic, not one-off.

That green and grey solutions each have pros and cons.

That adaptation is an iterative, resource-limited process.
Each playthrough subtly reinforces systems thinking.

üîÆ 10. Future Expansion Ideas

Terrain System: Lowlands, rivers, and coastlines affect flood risk.

Maintenance Cost: Older facilities degrade unless maintained.

Multi-hazard Mode: Add heatwaves or drought events.

Tech Tree: Unlock advanced solutions (AI drainage, smart sensors).

Story Mode: Procedural missions across different cities.

Placeholder visuals with simple colors

English UI with translation-ready keys

üß≠ 12. Design Philosophy

‚ÄúResilience is not built once ‚Äî it‚Äôs maintained every round.‚Äù

Adaptopolis is designed to feel like a puzzle of survival and optimization,
while implicitly teaching systems thinking about urban adaptation.

It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù against nature, but about learning to coexist within constraints ‚Äî
using limited space, money, and knowledge to build a future-ready city.
